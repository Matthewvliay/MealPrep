# MealPrep Project Description

MealPrep is an app I built in my sophomore year of high school to save my meal plans for the week ahead in school because I couldn't eat school lunch. It is my first ever CRUD application that uses localStorage to save cache data into the local users browser.

## 1. Clone the repo: 
```git clone https://github.com/matthewvliay/MealPrep.git```

## 2. Install Dependancies
```npm install```

Once this is done, you can start the app with:

```npm run dev-server```
