# MealPrep

MealPrep is an app I built in my sophomore year of high school to save my meal plans for the week ahead in school because I couldn't eat school lunch. It is my first ever CRUD application that uses localStorage to save cache data into the local users browser.

To run it, simply do:
npm install
npm run dev-server
